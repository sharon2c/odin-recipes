        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            I am sharing my recipe for the best fudgy brownies! 
            A special addition of <em>espresso</em> gives these brownies 
            a rich flavor that blends itself with the rest of the ingredients!
            These brownies will deliver you a dense, fudgy middle with crinkly tops,
            which is achieved by whisking the egg mixture until it is full and dense.
            Make sure to let it <strong>harden</strong> in the fridge first 
            and enjoy it with coffee and milk. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g dark chocolate</li>
            <li>120g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>120g egg</li>
            <li>150g brown sugar</li>
            <li>2g vanilla extract</li>
            <li>40g all purpose flour (or sub in almond flour)</li>
            <li>25g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2g salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Brown the butter. Then add the chopped chocolate chunks and mix 
                until fully melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the egg, brown sugar, and vanilla extract on top of a boiled water 
                until all the sugar is melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat the egg mixture using a hand mixer until fully whipped. 
                Then combine the chocolate mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sift and fold the flour, cocoa powder, and salt onto the mixture.
                Do <strong>not</strong> overmix as this will make the texture to be cake-like.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to the pan and make it flat.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 340F for 25-30 min. Let it cool before serving.</li>
        </ol>
